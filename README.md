# GorillaTagModsTutorial
This repository helps people install modifications to the popular virtual reality game "Gorilla Tag"

# ⚠️ THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR WINDOWS 10/11. THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR LINUX, MAC OS, OR QUEST STANDALONE ⚠️

Make sure to read the warning above so you dont install mods on the wrong OS!!

### Easy Method

The easiest way to install mods is through a program called "Monke Mod Manager". This executable is safe and not a virus. If your anti-virus detects it as a virus, its a false positive. This is due to the program installing external files. Also, another reason windows will flag it is because these programs are not registered with microsoft. Please refer to the manual method to install mods if you do not trust Monke Mod Manager.

Now that we have covered that, please install Monke Mod manager

After installing that, please run the executable. Select all the mods you'd like to install.
